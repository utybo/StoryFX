### License

Full license information for all of the files available here is available in the `LICENSE` information. This software is available under the MPL 2.0 license and is incompatible with secondary licenses.

**Important:** This repository uses the MPL 2.0 license *with the "incompatibility with secondary licenses" clause*. This is not a mistake. I, [the original author of the software](https://github.com/utybo), consider the GPL family of licenses to be harmful for developers and, ultimately, users. Thus, this software is *not* GPL-compatible.

In short: you are *not* able to publish any of this software in larger works governed by the GPL or AGPL licenses because of limitations from the GPL licenses themselves. You are still able to use this software in larger works governed by other licenses (including proprietary licenses). For more information, refer to the MPL license itself.

## Documentation

Documentation on the creation of stories should come soon (maybe).
